## Chosen Problem Statement
### Reshaping payments - Wallets
We embarked on a mission to create an innovative and user-friendly e-wallet app, harnessing the power of modern technology. Our development journey led us to utilize two robust platforms: React Native and Firebase. We also implemented currency conversion feature which empowers users to effortlessly convert their wallet balance into four prominent currencies: Euro, UK Pound, Malaysian Ringgit, and US Dollar. This feature not only expands the app's utility but also allows users to manage their finances with greater flexibility.

Embracing the growing interest in cryptocurrencies, we plan to incorporate a crypto wallet into our app. Users will have the ability to buy, sell, and securely store cryptocurrencies, making our e-wallet a one-stop solution for both traditional and digital assets.

### Advanced Bill Splitting:
We are committed to simplifying financial interactions further. Our future plans include enhancing the bill-splitting feature, enabling users to divide expenses accurately among multiple participants, whether for dinner with friends or shared household costs.

### Investment Opportunities:
To empower users in growing their wealth, we intend to introduce investment options within our app. Users can explore various investment vehicles, from stocks and bonds to mutual funds and savings plans, all accessible through their e-wallet.

### Promo Code and Rewards System:
We understand the value of incentives. Our future roadmap includes a robust promo code and rewards system, where users can enter promo codes for discounts, cashback, or other benefits. Loyalty rewards will also be part of this initiative, offering users compelling reasons to continue using our app.
